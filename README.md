# Faster Project Plus Installer for Linux

A script for compiling Faster Project Plus on Linux. Current Version: **2.1**

Currently tested on Ubuntu, but should work across *all* distributions given the right dependencies. Older versions can be found under `config/legacy/`.

## Dependencies needed (install these first!)

### Ubuntu 20.04
If running Ubuntu 20.04 or other distros based on it you must install this dep as well.

`sudo apt install libxxf86vm-dev`

You must also tell the installer you are running it as well. 

## Other Deps
For Ubuntu 16.04 and greater:

`sudo apt install curl md5sum cmake pkg-config git libao-dev libasound2-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libbluetooth-dev libenet-dev libgtk2.0-dev liblzo2-dev libminiupnpc-dev libopenal-dev libpulse-dev libreadline-dev libsfml-dev libsoil-dev libsoundtouch-dev libswscale-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libwxbase3.0-dev libwxgtk3.0-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev portaudio19-dev zlib1g-dev libudev-dev libevdev-dev "libpolarssl-dev|libmbedtls-dev" libcurl4-openssl-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libpng-dev qtbase5-private-dev`

For most users (including Fedora 24+), see [this page](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Building_Dolphin_on_Linux) for an easy to install list of dependencies; otherwise, see below.

### NixOS: 

See [attached README, written by fletchers#4892](../other_distros/NixOS/INSTALL.md)

### Solus (possible list, untested):

`sudo eopkg it -c system.devel`

`sudo eopkg it libgtk-2-devel libgtk-3-devel wxwidgets-devel libsm-devel gtest-devel llvm-devel lzo-devel mbedtls-devel miniupnpc-devel libxrandr-devel libxi-devel alsa-lib-devel bluez-devel mesalib-devel curl-devel enet-devel libevdev-devel pulseaudio-devel libusb-devel openal-soft-devel portaudio-devel sdl2-devel SFML-devel soundtouch-devel git cmake pkg-config gcc readline-devel libxext-devel libao-devel md5sum`

## Dependencies Optional

`axel` or `aria2c`

Gives  a fast way to download the SD card. 
Defaults to wget without them.
Wget is extremeley slow by comparision.

| UrlDownloader | Download Time |   |
|---------------|---------------|---|
| axel          | 1-2 min(s)    |   |
| aria2c        | 3-4 mins      |   |
| wget          | 15-20 mins    |   |

## Instructions: (READ FULLY BEFORE FOLLOWING)

1. Install necessary dependcies listed using guide above. Don't forget that optional deps will bring fast downloads.
2. Use install script to obtain FPP.

```

If a different version is needed (e.g. not SL default), edit the script and replace the desired variables.

Packed config structure: main folder named `Binaries/`, with  `User/`, `Sys/`, `portable.txt`, and `version-####.txt`(optional) packed inside.

## Changelog

### Thanks to:

The entire FasterMelee team, without their installer as a base, this would probably not have been written.

They thank the following people so it felt appropriate to thank them here as well:

    /u/ParadigmComplex. "Seriously, I could not have finished the original script without this guy."

    /u/jojorino and Hannesmann: "always testing and helping, as well as the rest of the FM discord!"

    "Also thanks to xanax, CilanMan, /u/algebra123230, /u/folfess for incremental improvements!"
